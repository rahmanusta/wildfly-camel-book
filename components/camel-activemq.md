# camel-activemq

Camel ActiveMQ integration is provided by the [camel-activemq component](http://camel.apache.org/activemq.html).

The component can be configured to work with an embedded or external broker. For Wildfly / EAP container managed connection pools and XA-Transaction support, the [ActiveMQ Resource Adapter](http://activemq.apache.org/resource-adapter.html) can be configured into the container configuration file.
